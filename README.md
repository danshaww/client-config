# Ansible Client Setup
  
This repository contains a script, Ansible playbook and associated configuration to provision a WSL/Linux client to my liking.  
  
To execute this script, you must first duplicate the vars_template.yml as vars.yml, and populate the vars found in the template with the appropriete values.
